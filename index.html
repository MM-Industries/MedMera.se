    <h2>The lords prayer</h2>
    <p class="text">
        Our father who arent in heaven<br>
        Hallowed be thy name<br>
        Thy will be done<br>
        Thy kingdom come<br>
        One earth as it is in heaven<br>
        Give us this day our daily bread<br>
        and forgive us our trespasses<br>
        As we forgive them that trespass against us<br>
        Lead us not into temptation<br>
        And deliver us from evil<br>
        For thine is the power and glory<br>
        forever and ever<br>
        Amen
